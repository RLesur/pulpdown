## Build the book with GitLab {-}

Since GitLab offers a git version control service and a CI/CD service in one application, the easiest way to build this book is to import this repository on GitLab^[see an example here: <https://gitlab.com/RLesur/pulpdown>.].  
Once imported, the book will be automatically built after each commit and you will find the pdf file in the artifacts folder^[see <https://gitlab.com/RLesur/pulpdown/pipelines>.] or directly using the url: `https://username.gitlab.io/repo/pulpdown.pdf`.
