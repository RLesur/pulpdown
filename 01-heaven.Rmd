## Build the book on GitLab {-}

Since GitLab offers a git version control service and a CI/CD service in one application, the easiest way to build the book is to import this repository on GitLab.  
Once imported, the book will be automatically built and you will find the pdf file in the artifacts folder or directly using the url: `username.gitlab.io/repo/pulpdown.pdf`.
